# Student-Database-Management-System
Building a student database management system using c++


This project aims to build a student database management system using the c++ programming language. This project enables both students and faculty to 'login'and view marks scored in five different subjects. In addition the faculty can edit scores, add new students and save their details. The program uses simple implementation of class-object concept along with the use of files and streams. 
These operations are carried out using various member functions-
 void addnewstudent() -add-details-of-new-student-admin
 void studentlogin()  -check-for-the-marks
 void facultylogin()  -enter-the-marks
 void adminview()     -show-all-data
 
The code is provided with proper comments to give the user a clear idea of what is being done. 

To note:
